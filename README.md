# GIN
Global Integrative Network, for integration of signaling and metabolic pathways

The basic layout of the signaling and metabolic pathways were uniformed into the structure similar to chemical reactionsï¼š

The GINs of human(hsa), mouse(mmu), arabidopsis(ath) and rice(osa) can be found in the folder "GINs_four_species". The relations extracted from "PPrel" and "PCrel" were stored in the "*.pprel.*" files, while the relations extracted from "reactions" were stored in "*.reaction.*" files.<br>
To parse the KEGG kgml files representing signaling and metabolic pathways, we built a R package based upon the KEGGREST API. The package requires KEGGREST which can be installed by:<br>
```
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("KEGGREST")
```
Then load the package:<br>
<code>library(KEGGREST)</code><br>
